# Fractal Geometry and Landscapes
### Fractal
- Derived from the latin word `fractus` (broken)
- A fractal is a geometric shape is generated using a series of recursive rules
- Has a pattern that repeats at different levels, also called *self-similarity*

#### Self-Similarity
- Three types
- **Exact self-similarity (strongest)**: 
	- The fratals are identical at different scales
- **Quasi-self-similarity**: 
	- Fractal appears approximately identical at different stales. These fractals contain small copies of the entire fractal in *distorted* forms
- **Statistical self-similarity (weakast)**:
	- The fractal has *numerical or statistical measures* which are preserved across scales.
	- Random fractals are examples of fractals which are statistically self-similar, but neither exactly nor quasi self similar

# unimelb-notes

**Hello!**

My name is Samuel Xu. I'm studying Computing Systems and Software at The Unviersity of Melbourne.

I've always enjoyed making notes before an exam. Although I've been a decidedly average student, I found that some of my peers liked my notes.
So, I've decided to upload whatever I write for the rest of my courses!

Hopefully you will find these useful :smiley:

<sub>p.s. I am not responsible for any possible bodily harm, anxiety, depression, loss of marks or allergies to seafood that may arise from using these notes.</sub>

**Good Luck, and Godspeed!**

**Update:**

I've since graduated and moved to Sydney to work for [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/). It's been awesome! Message me if you want to know anything! 

Here are some resources I've found useful on my journey.

- [Typescript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/) - My role has been on a Node/Typescript stack, highly recommend this book if you're keen on learning it!
- [The Missing Semester of your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) - All sorts of miscellaneous good-to-know stuff they don't teach you in uni
- [Developer Roadmap 2020](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) - What do I want to do??????

Of course, there's a billion ways of revising for interviews. Can't really go wrong with cracking the coding interview, or smashing some problems on leetcode / hackerrank. Personally, I'd try to spend more time refining what you'll talk about outside of the programming section of an interview. I feel like in my case it was more important to revise general software design questions and general speech skills than know how to flip a whatever-the-heck-kinda-tree they call it these days. For the most part, it's definitely underrated how far articulating your thought process well can take you.

I'd also keep in mind that as great as it is to spend all your energy revising for interviews and looking for the next job, take it easy. There's always tomorrow - you _don't need to have your shit together before uni ends_. It's not worth the stress (At least, that's what I wish I could have told myself!).

Check out these things I found along the way:

- [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) - A repo full of all sorts of interview preparation
- [what-happens-when](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) - An awesome explanation of all the things that happen when you type 'google.com' into your search bar (a great way to get a full picture of how things work)

If you find more things, feel free to make a PR!

## Contents:

### 2018 (Semester 2)

Final semester of Undergraduate degree (hopefully!). This semester I'll be continuing to use Markdown for nice inline Github notes :smile:
- [**IT Project (COMP30022)**](COMP30022)
- [**Graphics and Interactions (COMP30019)**](COMP30019)
- [**Models of Computation (COMP30026)**](COMP30026)

### 2018 (Semester 1)

This semester I decided to experiment using Markdown instead. It's a more universal format than the [Notes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Notes) syntax I previously used and, more importantly, renders nicely in GitHub and allows the use of inline images. I wrote everything using Sublime Text with the [ImagePaste](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ImagePaste) package, which allows you to `Ctrl+V` images into Sublime. I also used [Markdown Preview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownPreview) which allows you to preview your Markdown text as you write it!

*Note:* As Markdown allows use of inline images you should preserve the original file structure.

- [**Computer Systems (COMP30023)**](COMP30023)
	- (06/04/18) Completed up till week 6
	- (21/05/18) Completed the last Tutorial/Lecture
	- Crazy dense subject on networks. It's pretty good so far. :+1:
	- Arguably one of the most important courses in the unimelb Computer Science major
- [**Software Modelling and Design (SWEN30006)**](SWEN30006)
	- If you thought database systems was dry and uncoordinated, wait till you do this subject
	- Really inconsistent, conflicting information
	- Feels more like a section that we should've learnt about in OOSD and then never touched again
	- Head tutor for my year had a reputation for not being a great tutor
	- It's core for the Computer Science major, so prepare yourself. Hopefully it's better by then.
- [**Artificial Intelligence (COMP30024)**](COMP30024)
	- (31/05/18) Exam notes halfway completed
	- (04/06/18) Exam notes completed
	- Feels like an extension of Design of Algorithms. More search algorithms and some cool probability/machine learning stuff. It's pretty fun.
		- Contains [`examrev.md`](COMP30024/examrev.md), a short exam revision summary of the course and [`ai.pdf`](COMP30024/ai.pdf), a long, messy, 89-page set of notes which covers the course from start to end. Thanks to [@joannag6](https://github.com/joannag6) for sticking with me this sem! 

### 2017 (Semester 2)

Most of these notes were made with the [Notes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Notes) syntax and exported to pdf with the [Export to HTML](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ExportHtml) package, both for Sublime Text. Hopefully these haven't deprecated just yet!
- [**Object Oriented Software Development (SWEN20003)**](SWEN20003)
	- Pretty much a Crash Course in Java. Covers the basics of programming to some object oriented concepts such as polymorphism and abstract classes.
- [**Database Systems (INFO20003)**](INFO20003)
	- Content includes SQL, query processing and some database theory. 
	- <sub>also the content was really dry and it wasn't taught well due to new management but don't tell them i said that</sub>
- [**Declarative Programming (COMP30020 or COMP90048)**](COMP30020)
	- By far one of the better courses I've taken. Teaches the basics of Functional and Declarative Programming. Content includes how Haskell and Prolog work.
	- However notes only covers the Haskell section as the Prolog section was lost to time :disappointed:

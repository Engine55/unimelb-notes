# unimelb-notes

**Hello!**

My name is Samuel Xu. I'm studying Computing Systems and Software at The Unviersity of Melbourne.

I've always enjoyed making notes before an exam. Although I've been a decidedly average student, I found that some of my peers liked my notes.
So, I've decided to upload whatever I write for the rest of my courses!

Hopefully you will find these useful :smiley:

<sub>p.s. I am not responsible for any possible bodily harm, anxiety, depression, loss of marks or allergies to seafood that may arise from using these notes.</sub>

**Good Luck, and Godspeed!**

## Contents:

### 2018 (Semester 1) Work in Progress :construction:

Currently halfway through the sem. Experimenting using Markdown instead. Note that as Markdown allows use of inline images you should preserve the original file structure.
- Computer Systems (COMP30023)
	- (06/04/18) Completed up till week 6 (mid-semester summary still WIP)
		- Crazy dense subject on networks. It's pretty good so far. :+1:
	- (21/05/18) Completed the last Tutorial/Lecture
- Software Modelling and Design (SWEN30006) [t.b.d.] :construction:
- Artificial Intelligence (COMP30024) [t.b.d.] :construction:
	- (31/05/18) Exam notes halfway completed

### 2017 (Semester 2)

Most of these notes were made with the [Notes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Notes) syntax and exported to pdf with the [Export to HTML](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ExportHtml) package, both for Sublime Text. Hopefully these haven't deprecated just yet!
- Object Oriented Software Development (SWEN20003)
	- Pretty much a Crash Course in Java. Covers the basics of programming to some object oriented concepts such as polymorphism and abstract classes.
- Database Systems (INFO20003)
	- Content includes SQL, query processing and some database theory. 
	- <sub>also the content was really dry and it wasn't taught well due to new management but don't tell them i said that</sub>
- Declarative Programming (COMP30020 or COMP90048)
	- By far one of the better courses I've taken. Teaches the basics of Functional and Declarative Programming. Content includes how Haskell and Prolog work.
	- However notes only covers the Haskell section as the Prolog section was lost to time :disappointed:
